      <title>On Vim</title>

      <description>A lot has been said about Vim by programmers. For something that is just yet another fancy hammer to help construct a program, too much has been said about it.
Yet I found most of it not constructive to my personal experience of using Vim. Too many people take an extreme position and vehemently speak for or against it, most likely because it becomes a belief attached to their identity, much like a religion.</description>

      <title>Non-Controversial Opinion: Internet Shutdowns</title>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;d think it&amp;rsquo;s easy to agree that internet shutdowns are an uncontroversially terrible idea, except the Indian Government loves to do them so much, that I don&amp;rsquo;t even know anymore.
Human rights violations and suppression of freedom reasons aside â€” it is still so painfully destructive. Economic productivity is ruined and a lot of critical systems rely on the internet. It causes more chaos as information is no more easily verifiable and people would rely more on hearsay.</description>
