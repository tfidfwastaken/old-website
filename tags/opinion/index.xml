      <title>On Vim</title>
      <link>http://atharva.social/feed/vim/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has been said about Vim by programmers. For something that is just yet another fancy hammer to help construct a program, too much has been said about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet I found most of it not constructive to my personal experience of using Vim. Too many people take an extreme position and vehemently speak for or against it, most likely because it becomes a belief attached to their identity, much like a religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with the irony not lost on me, here&amp;rsquo;s what I have to say about Vim, and whether it&amp;rsquo;s worth learning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim is a trade-off involving time. To an experienced Vimmer, it supposedly greatly increases productivity. But to get to that experience where you are supposedly &lt;a href=&#34;https://wrongsideofmemphis.com/2013/03/27/vim-speed-is-not-really-the-point/&#34;&gt;coding like a samurai&lt;/a&gt; you need to invest time into learning this complicated multimodal paradigm for editing text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who invested a decent chunk of this time, it sure &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; faster and I am probably not going back to the standard way. But has it actually increased my productivity? I cannot tell as of now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I am ever asked about whether one should learn Vim, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend against using it. Because the learning cost is huge and the benefit gained from it is, in my opinion, largely varying from person-to-person. So its worth is not clear. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this, shall be the first and last time I write about Vim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sysadmins – You have a stronger argument, as most *nix machines support Vim and it&amp;rsquo;s terminal friendly. But editors like nano exist as well with little to no learning curve. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>Non-Controversial Opinion: Internet Shutdowns</title>
      <link>http://atharva.social/feed/internet-shutdown/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;d think it&amp;rsquo;s easy to agree that internet shutdowns are an uncontroversially terrible idea, except the Indian Government loves to do them so much, that I don&amp;rsquo;t even know anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human rights violations and suppression of freedom reasons aside — it is still so painfully destructive. Economic productivity is ruined and a lot of critical systems rely on the internet. It causes more chaos as information is no more easily verifiable and people would rely more on hearsay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you end up with scenarios straight out of a dark comedy.
As &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.medianama.com/2017/12/223-namapolicy-internet-shutdowns-happen-work/&#34;&gt;this article explains&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An amusing outcome of the 100-day ban was that since the internet was down, a state government order to lift the shutdown from Kolkata didn’t reach Darjeeling on time, so the ban kept getting extended by the district administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that if your area faces frequent internet shutdowns, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to keep &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/internet-shutdown-toolkit-list-of-messaging-apps-that-will-work-without-internet&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;  in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
