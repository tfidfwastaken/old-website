      <title>When Should I Say Something</title>

      <description>My heuristic for figuring out whether I should say anything online:
 Has anyone said it more eloquently? Does it say/reveal something sufficiently new for most of the readers that will come across it? 1 Is my perspective on this is sufficiently unique and dictated by my experience?  And this is why I don&amp;rsquo;t have much writing online. Most of my ideas cannot percolate down those three questions.
 Don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about being new for the readers when there are no readers, amirite [return]   </description>

      <title>Process and Tests</title>

      <description>A test evaluates the outcome of a process.
A good way to know if a system is not doing well is if the process is designed around the test, or to put it more bluntly, the process is hacked to optimize for the test.1
Examples that come to mind:
 Schools, where teaching is more about making students do well in their test rather than sharing knowledge and making people curious and critical thinkers.</description>
