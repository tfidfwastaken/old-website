<p>I&rsquo;m not that good at describing myself so I let a friend who cannot draw Santa Claus do it:</p>

<p>(definitely not edited to make myself look better)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Atharva has an odd sense of humour and the curiosity of a five-year old. He is moderately easy to talk to and will most definitely <em>appear</em> like he knows everything about everything.</p>

<p>I got a free server, a free domain, and a lot of free time, and that&rsquo;s why you are seeing this.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-m-listening-to-these-days">What I&rsquo;m listening to these days</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Otoboke Beaver - Itekoma Hits<br />
A high energy, playful and funny punk rock band from Japan. So much fun. All members have great chemistry. Their titling game here is also strong with titles like &ldquo;6 Day Working Week Is a Pain&rdquo;.</p></li>

<li><p>Backxwash - God Has Nothing To Do With This Leave Him Out Of It<br />
A dark, abrasive and aggressive record with odd sampling choices (and sometimes wonderfully harsh guitars) tied together with Backxwash&rsquo;s intense delivery. Some of the most progressive and fantastic music I have heard all year.</p></li>

<li><p>Portishead - Dummy<br />
A trip hop classic that I recently discovered. The grimy ambient sounds and trashy drum loops juxtaposed with the lead singer&rsquo;s strong but serene vocals make for an amazing aesthetic.</p></li>

<li><p>RTJ4 - Run The Jewels<br />
Great tracks, great rapping, great chemistry, a timely (albeit mostly for America) message on really solid well produced beats that <em>slap</em>. And yet, like with all other Run The Jewels projects, I won&rsquo;t be going back to this ever for the most part. Doesn&rsquo;t really click with me.</p></li>

<li><p>The New Abnormal- The Strokes<br />
The Strokes give that magical nostalgic sound of guitars and synths with Julian Casablanca&rsquo;s emotionally potent delivery, that make for a really solid album. Probably my favourite this year so far.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-i-m-reading-now">What I&rsquo;m reading now</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, (Abelson, (* 2 Sussman))<br />
SICP is a renowned book that teaches program design through Scheme.</p></li>

<li><p>The Design of Everyday Things, Donald Norman<br />
A really nice book that talks about everyday design. Goes into human psychology as well as design processes for making human friendly things. I haven&rsquo;t touched this in a while but I intend to finish it so I am leaving this here.</p></li>
</ul>
