      <title>When Should I Say Something</title>

      <description>My heuristic for figuring out whether I should say anything online:
 Has anyone said it more eloquently? Does it say/reveal something sufficiently new for most of the readers that will come across it? 1 Is my perspective on this is sufficiently unique and dictated by my experience?  And this is why I don&amp;rsquo;t have much writing online. Most of my ideas cannot percolate down those three questions.
 Don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about being new for the readers when there are no readers, amirite [return]   </description>

      <title>3D Printing is affordable now</title>

      <description>I did not realise that 3D printers are reasonably affordable now — one of those few things that make me feel like 2020 has arrived.
Now the only need that remains is a steady supply of electricity that will let me do prints without interruptions.</description>

      <title>Process and Tests</title>
      <link>http://atharva.social/feed/processandtests/</link>

      <description>A test evaluates the outcome of a process.
A good way to know if a system is not doing well is if the process is designed around the test, or to put it more bluntly, the process is hacked to optimize for the test.1
Examples that come to mind:
 Schools, where teaching is more about making students do well in their test rather than sharing knowledge and making people curious and critical thinkers.</description>

      <title>On Vim</title>
      <link>http://atharva.social/feed/vim/</link>

      <description>A lot has been said about Vim by programmers. For something that is just yet another fancy hammer to help construct a program, too much has been said about it.
Yet I found most of it not constructive to my personal experience of using Vim. Too many people take an extreme position and vehemently speak for or against it, most likely because it becomes a belief attached to their identity, much like a religion.</description>

      <title>Non-Controversial Opinion: Internet Shutdowns</title>
      <link>http://atharva.social/feed/internet-shutdown/</link>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;d think it&amp;rsquo;s easy to agree that internet shutdowns are an uncontroversially terrible idea, except the Indian Government loves to do them so much, that I don&amp;rsquo;t even know anymore.
Human rights violations and suppression of freedom reasons aside — it is still so painfully destructive. Economic productivity is ruined and a lot of critical systems rely on the internet. It causes more chaos as information is no more easily verifiable and people would rely more on hearsay.</description>
